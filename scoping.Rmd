## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Write a short comment describing this function
```{r}
ulimit -s unlimited
```

```{r}
#matrix functiont that caches inverse#
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<-NULL
  }
get<- function() x
setInverse <- function(inverse) inv<<-inverse
getInverse <- function() inv
list (set = set, get = get, SetInverse = SetInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}
```

```{r}
make
```



## Write a short comment describing this function

#solves the inverse of the matrix from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)){
        return(inv)
}
data <- x$get()
inv <- solve(data)
x$setInverse(inv)
inv
}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
